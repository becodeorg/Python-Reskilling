= Introduction

// TODO: write a small introduction to python.

Notice that variable assignment is done using a single equal operator "=",
whereas comparison between two variables is done using the double equals
operator "==". The "not equals" operator is marked as "!=".

Python uses indentation to define code blocks, instead of brackets. The standard
Python indentation is 4 spaces, although tabs and any other space size will
work, as long as it is consistent. Notice that code blocks do not need any
termination.

=== Python syntax

The syntax of the Python programming language is the set of rules that defines
how a Python program will be written and interpreted (by both the runtime system
and by human readers).The Python language has many similarities to Perl, C, and
Java. However, there are some definite differences between the languages.

==== Design philosophy

Python was designed to be a highly readable language. It has a relatively
uncluttered visual layout and uses English keywords frequently where other
languages use punctuation. Python aims to be simple and consistent in the design
of its syntax, encapsulated in the mantra "There should be one—and preferably
only one—obvious way to do it", from "The Zen of Python"

With python, forget the semicolons and curly braces to delimit the blocks.
Python works by line and prioritization is done with indentation.  We will see
this later with the conditions and functions

==== Indentation

Python uses whitespace to delimit control flow blocks (following the off-side
rule). Python borrows this feature from its predecessor ABC: instead of
punctuation or keywords, it uses indentation to indicate the run of a block.

In so-called "free-format" languages — that use the block structure derived from
ALGOL — blocks of code are set off with braces ({ }) or keywords. In most coding
conventions for these languages, programmers conventionally indent the code
within a block, to visually set it apart from the surrounding code
(prettyprinting).

[source,python]
----
def foo(x):
    if x == 0:
        bar()
        baz()
    else:
        qux(x)
        foo(x - 1)

==== Comments in Python

A hash sign (#) that is not inside a string literal begins a comment. All
characters after the # and up to the end of the physical line are part of the
comment and the Python interpreter ignores them.

[source,python]
----
# My first comment 
name = "BeCode" # Name of school
----

The triple quotes are used to span the string across multiple lines. For
example, all the following are legal:

[source,python]
----
word = 'word'
sentence = "This is a sentence."
paragraph = """This is a paragraph. It is
made up of multiple lines and sentences."""
print(word)
print(sentence)
print(paragraph)

## Output
# word
# This is a sentence.
# This is a paragraph. It is
# made up of multiple lines and sentences.
----

Following triple-quoted string is also ignored by Python interpreter and can be
used as a multiline comments:

[source,python]
----
"""
This is a multiline
comment.
"""
----

==== Quotation in Python

Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote
string literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.

The triple quotes are used to span the string across multiple lines. For
example, all the following are legal :

[source,python]
----
word = 'word'
sentence = "This is a sentence."
paragraph = """This is a paragraph. It is
made up of multiple lines and sentences."""
print(word)
print(sentence)
print(paragraph)

## Output
# word
# This is a sentence.
# This is a paragraph. It is
# made up of multiple lines and sentences.
----

==== Reserved Words

The following list shows the Python keywords. These are reserved words and you
cannot use them as constants or variables or any other identifier name. All
Python keywords contain only lowercase letters.

|===
| and | exec | not
| assert | finally | or
| break | for | pass
| class | from | print
| continue | global | raise
| def | if | return
| del | import | try
