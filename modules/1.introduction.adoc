== Learning Material

=== Setup the environment

First thing first, if you want to code in python, you need a working _Python
environment_. Python is an *interpreted language* without going too much into
details that means that your code is not compiled and can be evaluated _on the
fly_ by the _interpreter_. However, it also means that you *need the interpreter
installed everywhere the code would be run*.

NOTE: On the internet you will hear a lot about two versions of Python: 2 and 3.
Know that you should use Python 3 for all your projects as Python 2 is no longer
maintained.

==== Installation

On to the installation, the process will be different depending on which _OS_
you are using and how exactly you want your python environment setup (_access
python from the terminal, directly on your text editor, etc..._).

Hopefully, the internet is full of {install}[guides] and your first mission is
to try and install Python by yourself. Don't worry the coaches can and will be
there to answer any questions you may have during that process.

==== Running your first program

===== Run commands directly in the shell

Try to open the _Python shell_ (hint: _type `py` on windows, `python3` on
linux_), then write the following command:

[source,python]
----
print("Python is fun!") # Output: Python is fun!
----

And that’s it. You’ve just written your first Python program! Each time you
enter a line, Python immediately execute the statement, displaying the value
between the quotes.

===== Run a file.py

It's nice to be able to code directly from the interpreter, but you will in most
case want to feed *scripts* to it. Let's see all the steps needed to do this.

* open you text editor of choice
* create a file _test.py_
* write `print("Python is fun!")` within it
* save it :)
* execute the script from your default shell `python path/to/file`

NOTE: Here I use the command `python`, but depending on your _OS_ or
_distribution_ it might be different (ex: `py`, `python3`).


=== Python syntax

The syntax of the Python programming language is the set of rules that defines
how a Python program will be written and interpreted (by both the runtime system
and by human readers).The Python language has many similarities to Perl, C, and
Java. However, there are some definite differences between the languages.

==== Design philosophy

Python was designed to be a highly readable language. It has a relatively
uncluttered visual layout and uses English keywords frequently where other
languages use punctuation. Python aims to be simple and consistent in the design
of its syntax, encapsulated in the mantra "There should be one—and preferably
only one—obvious way to do it", from "The Zen of Python"

With python, forget the semicolons and curly braces to delimit the blocks.
Python works by line and prioritization is done with indentation.  We will see
this later with the conditions and functions

==== Indentation

Python uses whitespace to delimit control flow blocks (following the off-side
rule). Python borrows this feature from its predecessor ABC: instead of
punctuation or keywords, it uses indentation to indicate the run of a block.

In so-called "free-format" languages — that use the block structure derived from
ALGOL — blocks of code are set off with braces ({ }) or keywords. In most coding
conventions for these languages, programmers conventionally indent the code
within a block, to visually set it apart from the surrounding code
(prettyprinting).

[source,python]
----
def foo(x):
    if x == 0:
        bar()
        baz()
    else:
        qux(x)
        foo(x - 1)
----

==== Comments in Python

A hash sign (#) that is not inside a string literal begins a comment. All
characters after the # and up to the end of the physical line are part of the
comment and the Python interpreter ignores them.

[source,python]
----
# My first comment 
name = "BeCode" # Name of school
----

The triple quotes are used to span the string across multiple lines. For
example, all the following are legal:

[source,python]
----
word = 'word'
sentence = "This is a sentence."
paragraph = """This is a paragraph. It is
made up of multiple lines and sentences."""
print(word)
print(sentence)
print(paragraph)

## Output
# word
# This is a sentence.
# This is a paragraph. It is
# made up of multiple lines and sentences.
----

Following triple-quoted string is also ignored by Python interpreter and can be
used as a multiline comments:

[source,python]
----
"""
This is a multiline
comment.
"""
----

==== Quotation in Python

Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote
string literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.

The triple quotes are used to span the string across multiple lines. For
example, all the following are legal :

[source,python]
----
word = 'word'
sentence = "This is a sentence."
paragraph = """This is a paragraph. It is
made up of multiple lines and sentences."""
print(word)
print(sentence)
print(paragraph)

## Output
# word
# This is a sentence.
# This is a paragraph. It is
# made up of multiple lines and sentences.
----

==== Reserved Words

The following list shows the Python keywords. These are reserved words and you
cannot use them as constants or variables or any other identifier name. All
Python keywords contain only lowercase letters.

|===
| and | exec | not
| assert | finally | or
| break | for | pass
| class | from | print
| continue | global | raise
| def | if | return
| del | import | try
| elif | in | while
| else | is | with
| except | lambda | yield
|===

=== Variables and data types

Variables are used to temporarily store a value in the computer's memory. We can
then use it later, when we need it in the program. We can compare that to a
small box in which we could store information.

Since Python is a dynamically typed language, Python values, not variables,
carry type. This has implications for many aspects of the way the language
functions.

All variables in Python hold references to objects, and these references are
passed to functions; a function cannot change the value of variable references
in its calling function (but see below for exceptions). Some people (including
Guido van Rossum himself) have called this parameter-passing scheme "Call by
object reference." An object reference means a name, and the passed reference is
an "alias", i.e. a copy of the reference to the same object, just as in C/C++.
The object's value may be changed in the called function with the "alias", for
example:

==== Naming and code writing conventions

As in many programming languages, to name a variable, some conventions must be
respected.

The name of the variable must start with a letter or an underscore. The variable
can not start with a number or a hyphen.

[source,python]
----
## Bad examples (do not do this):
2Name = "James" 
-name = "James"

## Good examples (do this):
name = "James" 
_name = "James"
----

Never put space between words. You can use multiple naming conventions. Camel
Case, Pascal Case, underscore case, etc ... Whatever you choose, keep it for the
whole project.

[source,python]
----
## Bad example (do not do this):
My name = "Odile"

## Good example (do this):
myName = "Odile" 
MyName = "Odile"
my_name = "Odile"
----

No accents on the names of variables. Use only English

[source,python]
----
## Bad example (do not do this):
prénom = "Odile"

## Good example (do this):
firstName = "Odile"
----

Always give an explicit name to the variable.

[source,python]
----
## Bad example (do not do this):
a = "Odile" 
fstnme = "Odile"

## Good example (do this):
firstName = "Odile" 
magicPotion = 42
----

==== Numbers

Python supports two types of numbers - integers and floating point numbers. (It
also supports complex numbers, which will not be explained in this tutorial).

To define an integer, use the following syntax:

[source,python]
----
myint = 7
print(myint)
----

To define a floating point number, you may use one of the following notations:

[source,python]
----
myfloat = 7.0
print(myfloat)
myfloat = float(7)
print(myfloat)
----

==== Strings

Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes.

[source,python]
----
mystring = 'hello'
print(mystring)
mystring = "hello"
print(mystring)
----

The difference between the two is that using double quotes makes it easy to
include apostrophes (whereas these would terminate the string if using single
quotes)

[source,python]
----
mystring = "Don't worry about apostrophes"
print(mystring)
----

There are additional variations on defining strings that make it easier to
include things such as carriage returns, backslashes and Unicode characters.

Simple operators can be executed on numbers and strings:

[source,python]
----
one = 1
two = 2
three = one + two
print(three)

hello = "hello"
world = "world"
helloworld = hello + " " + world
print(helloworld)
----

Assignments can be done on more than one variable "simultaneously" on the same
line like this

[source,python]
----
a, b = 3, 4
print(a,b)
----

Mixing operators between numbers and strings is not supported:

[source,python]
----
# This will not work!
one = 1
two = 2
hello = "hello"

print(one + two + hello)
----

To format the text, you can use the format() method in the class string

[source,python]
----
lastName = "Bond"
firstName = "James"
text = "My name is {}, {} {}.".format(lastName, firstName, lastName)
print(text)
----

Another example. Replace the value of the variable age with your age and the
variable firstname with your First name.

[source,python]
----
age = "34"
firstName ="Chrysanthi"
text = "Hello, my name is {} and i am {}".format(firstName, age)
print(text)
----

==== Data types

Since Python is a high-level language, it has a dynamic variable typing. By
dynamics, understand that it is the computer that deals with defining what type
of variable should be used. To be perfectly accurate, it is not the variable
that is typed (unlike Java) but its content

In java we declare a variable like this: `String fisrtName = "James"`

We define the type of variable ourselves. With python we declare a variable like
this: `firstName = "James"`

And so, it's python that will define what type will be used.

[source,python]
----
firstName = "James" # String
lastName = "Bond"  # String
age = 39  # Integer
weigth = 81.56 # Float
doubleAgent = True # Boolean
login = "007" # String
agent = [firstName, lastName, age, weigth, doubleAgent, login] # List
print(agent)

## Output: ['James', 'Bond', 39, 81.56, True, '007']
----

Here is a not limited list of the types we use most often. These are the most
frequently used. For tuples, dictionaries and sets we'll see them later

|===
| Name | Type | Description

| Integers
| INT
| Whole numbers, such as : *1*, *67*, *5000*

| Floating point
| FLOAT
| Decimal point numbers, such as : *1.89*, *0.67*, *9.99999*

| Strings
| STR
| Ordered sequence of characters : *"Hello"*, *"10"*

| Lists
| LIST
| Ordered sequence of objects : *["hello", 10, 56.89]*

| Dictionaries
| DICT
| Unordered (Key : Value) pairs : *{"Key1": value, "name" : "Peter}*

| Tuples
| TUPLE
| Ordered sequence of objects (immutable) : *["hello", 10, 56.89]*

| Sets
| SET
| Unordered collections of unique objects : *{1,2}*

| Booleans
| BOOL
| Logical value : *True* or *False*
|===

There is a native python function that allows you to know what type of data you
have. This is the type() function

[source,python]
----
print(firstName, type(firstName))
print(lastName, type(lastName))
print(age, type(age))
print(weigth, type(weigth))
print(agent, type(agent))
----

If you want to specify the data type, you can use the following constructor
functions

[%header]
|===
| Example | Data type

| `x = str("Hello World")`
| _STR_

| `x = int(20)`
| _INT_

| `x = float(20.5)`
| _FLOAT_

| `x = complex(1j)`
| _COMPLEX_

| `x = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))`
| _LIST_

| `x = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))`
| _TUPLE_

| `x = range(6)`
| _RANGE_

| `x = dict(name="John", age=36)`
| _DICT_

| `x = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))`
| _SET_

| `x = frozenset(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))`
| _FROZENSET_

| `x = bool(5)`
| _BOOL_

| `x = bytes(5)`
| _BYTES_

| `x = bytearray(5)`
| BYTEARRAY

| `x = memoryview(bytes(5))	`
| _MEMORYVIEW_
|===

You can also convert from one type to another with the same functions, for
example:

[source,python]
----
x = 1 # int
y = 2.8 # float
z = 1j # complex

#convert from int to float:
a = float(x)

#convert from float to int:
b = int(y)

#convert from int to complex:
c = complex(x)

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
----

=== Basic operators

==== Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic Operators perform various arithmetic calculations like addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division, %modulus, exponent, etc. There are
various methods for arithmetic calculation in Python : you can use the eval
function or declare variable & calculate, or call functions.

[%header]
|===
| Operator | Description

| `+`
| Adds values on either side of the operator.

| `-`
| Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.

| `*`
| Multiplies values on either side of the operator

| `/`
| Divides left hand operand by right hand operand

| `%`
| Divides left hand operand by right hand operand

| `**`
| Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators

| `//`
| Floor Division - The division of operands where the result is the quotient in
which the digits after the decimal point are removed. But if one of the operands
is negative, the result is floored, i.e., rounded away from zero (towards
negative infinity) −
|===

[source,python]
----
## Example

## We begin by creating two variables and assign two values to them.
a = 10 
b = 20

## Addition
add = a + b
print(add) # Output: 30

## Subtraction
sub = b - a
print(sub) # Output: 10

## Multiplication
multi = a * b
print(multi) # Output: 200

## Division (in this case Python will return a FLOAT)
div = b / a
print(div) # Output: 2.0

## Floor division
floorDiv = b // a
print(floorDiv) # Output: 2

## Modulus
modulus = b % a
print("modulus :", modulus) # Output: 0
modulus2 = 21 % 2
print("modulus2 :", modulus2) # Output: 1 

## Exponent
exp = a**2
print(exp) # Output: 100
----

==== Comparison operators

These operators compare the values on either side of the operands and determine
the relation between them. It is also referred as relational operators. Various
comparison operators are ( ==, != , <>, >,<=, etc)

[%header]
|===
| Operator | Description

| `==`
| If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.

| `!=`
| If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.

| `>`
| If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then
condition becomes true.

| `<`
|	If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then
condition becomes true.

| `>=`
| If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right
operand, then condition becomes true.

| `<=`
| If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right
operand, then condition becomes true.
|===

[source,python]
----
## Example

## We begin by creating two variables and assign two values to them.
a = 10
b = 20

## Equals
print(a==b) # Output: False
print(a==10) # Output: True

## Not equals
print(a!=b) # Output: True
print(a!=10) # Output: False

## Bigger than
print(a>b) # Output: False
print(b>a) # Output: True

## Bigger or equal to
print(a>=b) # Output: False
print(b>=a) # Output: True

## Smaller than
print(a>b) # Output: False
print(b>a) # Output: True

## Smaller or equal to
print(a>=b) # Output: False
print(b>=a) # Output: True
----

==== Assignment operators

Python assignment operators are used for assigning the value of the right
operand to the left operand. Various assignment operators used in Python are
(+=, - = , *=, /= , etc.)

[%header]
|===
| Operator | Description

| `=`
| Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand

| `+=`
| It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left
operand

| `-=`
| It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left
operand

| `*=`
| It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to
left operand

| `/=`
| It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left
operand

| `%=`
| It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand

| `**=`
| Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators and assign value to the
left operand

| `//=`
| It performs floor division on operators and assign value to the left operand
|===

Let's try it. We create 2 variables and assign two values to them.

[source,python]
----
## Example

## Assignment
a = 10
name = "Alan Turing"
print(a) # Output: 10
print(name) # Output: Alan Turing

## Note: From now on you can only do these actions on the same data type.

## Add
a += 10
name += " is a good mathematician"
print(a) # Output: 20
print(name) # Output: Alan Turing is a good mathematician 

## Subtract (doesn't work with strings)
a = 20
a -= 10
print(a) # Output: 10

## Multiply
a = 10
a *= 10
print(a) # Output: 100

text = "Alan Turing"
text *= 10
print(text) # Output: Alan Turing ... Alan Turing

## Divide (doesn't work with strings)
a = 100
a /= 10
print(a) # Output: 10

## Modulus (doesn't work with strings)
a = 100
a %= 3
print(a) # Output: 1

## Exponent (doesn't work with strings)
a = 2 
a **= 3
print(a) # Output: 8

## Floor division (doesn't work with strings)
a = 20
a //= 3
print(a) # Output: 6
----

=== Built-in functions

The Python interpreter has a number of functions and types built into it that
are always available. We have already used them. Remember the print() function
which allows you to display text.

[source,python]
----
print("Hello World")
----

There is the `input()` method which allows the user to enter text.

[source,python]
----
age = input("How old are you?")
print("Your age", age)
----

The input value will always be a string. We'll use another native function to
check it.

[source,python]
----
print(type(age))
----

Functions that allow cast : str(), int (), float(), etc...

[source,python]
----
age = input("How old are you?")
print("string :", age, type(age))

age = int(age) # Cast from string to integer
print("integer :", age, type(age))

age =  float(age)# Cast from int to float
print("float :", age, type(age))

age =  str(age)# Cast from float to string
print("string :", age, type(age))
----

The `len()` function allows us to know how many elements are in a list or
string.

[source,python]
----
print(len("Hello Word"))

arr = ["one", "two"]
print(len(arr))
----
