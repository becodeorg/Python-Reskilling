= Python Reskilling

The main goal of the *Python Reskilling* is to give people the _fundamentals_ of
Python in *three days*. To achieve this *presentation* and *content* would be
given during the two first days, then a small project requiring all the
fundamentals would be made on the last.

This repository acts as *storage for content*, in the same manner as the
_Syllabus Becodus_.
