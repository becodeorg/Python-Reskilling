= Python Reskilling

The main goal of the *Python Reskilling* is to give people the _fundamentals_ of
Python in *three days*. To achieve this *presentation* and *modules* would be
given during the two first days, then a small project on the last.

This repository acts as *storage for modules*, in the same manner as the
_Syllabus Becodus_.


== Modules

* link:./[Conditions]
* link:./[Loops]
* link:./[Lists]
* link:./[Functions]

NOTE: Try to implement *good practices* (_PEP8_, _..._) in each module so that
they can be transmitted as seamlessly as possible.
